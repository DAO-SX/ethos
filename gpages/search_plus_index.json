WE ARE THE FULL TIME WEB3 BUILDER, NOT OTHERS. M: Build a Prototype Metaverse to accelerate the Exploration of the Metaverse. V: Low cost, No barrier, Fast access for Everyone to jump into the Metaverse. V: Simple Text Records Power Imaginations with Civilizations. Our Mission: Build for Web3 Textverse is Public goods for Community. Providing to plain users to join and play in a very Easy Mode: just Typing on any screen. Mint NFTs to help players to own their value and assets in Web3. Build relations with the DAOs by Tokens Exchange Stake, they are all the stake-holders of us. Textverse can help any communities,DAOs extend their story within a Text Metaverse. Also, we build a series of tools and smart contracts to solve the engineering problems. So the communities can focus on the Creative and Imaginations on their Metaverse. Cornerstone of the Web3. Our Vision: Everyone Jump into Metaverse We are Textverse, build Web3 Infrastructure, A Text Metaverse Engine Category Primitives. We build Public Goods for Web3 with Interoperability and Composability. Textverse has three parts: Open NFT Transfer Protocol with series of Smart contract, maintained by the Protocol DAO. Text Metaverse(Game) Engine with Web3 TID for any communities, free to use, maintained by the real company. DAO2DAO service mode(D2D,we create this first？) with ReGenEconomics is our long time service. Our Value: Text is Civilization. Literal is the basic and essence of the Human Civilization. We have Colorful world, good music, and pretty or handsome Stars. But we still need, the Power of Text, or Language Writing, the instinct of Express and Communication. So our mission is Simple Text Records Power Imaginations. Be the basement of the Metaverse Creation and Innovation. Problems with current As you know, we have many many Pixels and JPGs or 3Ds NFTs on the market. We call the NFT the entrance of the Metaverse. It will be multi Metaverse in the future. But no one gives a rule or protocol to connect the isolated NFTs and Metaverses. So we must build individual programs for different. And it will produce Value Isolation with different rules. Just like I have 500$ and saved in different banks, if you want to operate it, transfer or gather the assets, you can’t. Cause different banks have a variety of complex principles to save and withdraw. We need Interoperability and Composability for NFT in Metaverse. What are Interoperability and Composability? NFT is great but we can only show by PFP avatar, and nothing else can do. We define the Interoperability: Engineering Problems: we build protocols and contracts and infrastructures to run it. Economic Alignment: we build basic circulating Tokens, offer 80% belonging to Community Token Economics. Making it Fun: Yes! The most Creative guys are You, the plains. We offer the blocks, you finish the LEGO. We define the Composability: Compound: More and More, Connected Metaverse with code,interfaces, systems and tokens. Mods: Plugin and Plugout in anywhere. Build with technical and financial and funny stories. Cross Area: Walk through the Metaverse with Composable DID and TID can make you be Individual. Creator = Player = Beneficiary: Create and Earn, Play and Earn, we are stake-holder. Textverse Solution We have a basic idea called NFT Interoperability Standard. It can give abilities to NFT holders to INTERACTION with their NFTs, the strength of Interoperation. Like a Magic Transport, the Standard protocol can bridge the banks with simplicity and transparency and is open-source. Make your NFT assets can be transferred into and out of all Metaverse with infinite liquidity, we supply a handle convenience interface called ERC7211. Also empower the teams who create NFTs to make the monkeys or girlfriends on paper or Opensea page be alive in different Metaverse or same Metaverse. Yes, Transport your NFT to Metaverse with ONE Standard protocol and Play with it! Basic progress: flowchart TDcat DAOs --> B[Google-Apply-Form] --> C[Check the Form] --> D[Gnerate JSON] D --> E[(Run script)] --> F[Generate Docker] --> G[/Design the story/] --> H[Distribution run Docker,3 at least] H --> I[Load game test] --> J[Open for Community] Protocol 7211 Metaverse Registry We may have many Metaverse, so we must have a Metaverse list registry. We define the basic meta data of Metaverse, special for Text Metaverse. Transfer If you have any PFP NFTs, you can Transfer into Any (Text) Metaverses. Now you can make your NFT assets be Interoperated by your will. Transport After playing in the Jurassic park, you can Transport to the Ocean World in seconds. Just type the screen and switch channel like TV. Flow TID It was a ERC1155 NFT, free to mint and stake to earn. We will mint Crypto Tokens to record who support us, the Early Bird. So The Text Metaverse Registry will give you a TID record on the chain and backup in IPFS and Arweave. It can involve all your assets in the Metaverse with Hash link. Maybe in 20 years later, the DIGI DID(TID) will be your most of your life: work, credit, friends, community and fun. Join Textverse Community Welcome to everyone to join, free to play.

We mint tokens to record who give us the early resource. We don't want much more Tokens to be capitalism. So we need tokenomics article to show the plan clearly. The tokens list: 1) Member NFTs, owned by every early player or any DAO member(Limited 8.88 M). 2) NFT Velo eggs, 1024 with 10 B ERC20 token(80%->Community,20%->Team & advisor and Investor). 3) 22 M ERC20 tokens for governance(binding with Member NFT for airdrop). 4) 1 T ERC20 tokens for liquidity(binding with egg NFT). Content Four parts : Utility、Supply+Price Stable Mechanism、Distribution、Governance. Describe these and give some consultant and plan. Utility For DAO members(Member NFT) The contributors in the DAO, will mint one NFT to identify. If do any contributions in the DAO, will get basic tokens to record. All the benefits from below, will collect 80% to the DAO vault, and spend on DAO building and developing protocol. For example: contracts fee, 4.5%, tranport fee, basic 7.5%+ next Metaverse fee. Every player is our DAO member, so play and earn. Notice: NFT will burn your ERC20 Token in different speed on different member grade. For communities(Product egg NFT) We provide the Text Metaverse engine, called Textverse. Open source, everyone can build their own Metaverse with or without NFT. Just fork from our github branch and build your Metaverse. Also, we build the first Framework of Textverse, called Velo. We sell the Velo to anyone who want build their own Metaverse but have no efficient technology abilities, with NFT formate. We offer free Velos to our partners to build their Metaverse fastly. We build our own Textverse Demo BKS for free to play. For supporters(ERC20 Token) Yes, we will start our project on some launchpad, early investors can join. You can also to stake and mining or farming to get benefits. In all the Metaverses build with Textverse engine, will use our basic token.

Price: Phase 1: Publish Pubulic Metaverse BKS Phase 2: Build 3 DAOs Metaverse Phase 3: Set price for Egg(binding LToken) and free mint Member NFT, sold on Opensea and other platform. Activities: Creative and Mint: we airdrop to the FUN NFT design(Utility), for example: A box produces one Hamburger everyday. Distribution 20% belongs to Genesis, 80% belongs to TextverseDAO, to maintain and develop the protocol. Governance Community Governance: 80% GToken will be distributed to the Community. One NFT (member NFT) one vote. If you have Conclusion Build by Community, for Community. ERC20 token won't be individually sold out of any Metaverse. All NFTs(member NFT or Velo NFT) will benefits from the TextverseDAO Vaults. 20% liquidity token will distribute to Genesis, Advisor, Early Investor. 80% belongs to the DAO vaults to sustain the developing. The vote rights depends on the NFTs, not the Governance Token numbers. The benefits will distribute to Governance Token holders.
