### Utility

#### For DAO members(Member NFT)

+ The contributors in the DAO, will mint one NFT to **identify**.
+ If do any **contributions** in the DAO, will get basic tokens to **record**.

+ **Notice**: NFT will **burn** your ERC20 **Token** in different speed on different member grade.

#### For communities(Product egg NFT)

+ We provide the Text Metaverse **engine**, called Textverse.
+ Open source, everyone can build their own Metaverse with or without NFT.
+ Just fork from our github branch and build your Metaverse.
+ Also, we build the first **Framework** of Textverse, called [Velo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benz_Velo).
