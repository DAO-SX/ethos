## RealmsMUD

One of the oldest LPmuds, founded June 1991 Realmsmud is a large LP based MUD. There are over 60 different areas to explore for players ranging from level 1 to level 99. The standard rooms of the 3.2.1 lib have long since been replaced by a new city with multiple landscapes surrounding it, including forests, mountains, and even an ocean. Beyond the vast amount of rooms to explore, Realmsmud has 10 guilds and nine races available. Player killing is strictly optional, and not allowed until a player has progressed through several levels. Realmsmud also offers 20 quests for players to complete. The quests range in difficulty, and are given a point value to indicate just how difficult each are. Quests are optional unless a player wishes to attempt becoming a wizard. Tradeskills have been added to Realmsmud, giving players the option of creating weapons and armor. Blacksmithing, Jewelcraft, and Leathercraft are already available, and several more are in the development stages. There is not a level restriction for joining a trade. We have also introduced Global Storage which gives players the opportunity to store a restricted number of items over reboot. Feel free to drop in on us. New players will enter the game at Central Park (CP) after going through the brief character creation process. A new player will also be set to a temporary guild called "Adventurer". To help new players get acclimated to Realmsmud, they are given a chat line to ask questions on. Volunteer players above level 15, called newbie helpers, are online to answer any questions that a player might have about the mud. It is recommended that players join a guild as soon as possible. Once that player has joined a new guild, that player will gain access to the guild's storage rooms. Other members of the guild will probably help new players get started if nothing is available in storage, provided they are asked nicely, of course.

## Dead Souls (Well document, Public domain)

People who are new to creating and running a MUD, and need a mudlib that is well-coded, well-featured, well-documented, and works great right out of the box. Dead Souls comes configured with a working combat system, races (with limbs and detailed body stats), classes, magic system, emotes, postures (even flying), built-in ftp and web servers, menu-driven MUD administration tool, intermud network channels, QCS, a sample town loaded with examples of objects and quests, banking, economics, variable description based on time-of-day, and much, much more.

Can I charge players a fee for playing on my mud?

NO.

Dead Souls uses MudOS, and MudOS has a license that specifically
and strictly forbids its use in a commercial way. I don't care how
you use the lib, but if you use it with MudOS, you need to comply
with MudOS licensing. If you were to port Dead Souls to some other
driver that allows commercial use, then you'd be all set.

Can people donate money to me for the mud?

Yes.

So long as there is no quid-pro-quo, or anything
about the transaction that is legally regarded as "commercial",
receiving money from people for the purpose of running the
mud is ok. However, I am not a lawyer, so read the MudOS
license yourself.

You should not try to bend the rules. For
example, public television channels often give trinkets to
donors as a token of their appreciation. If someone donates
money to you for your mud and they get a "thank you gift",
this is a quid-pro-quo, or "something for something", and
it's not right.

This is a MudOS thing, not a Dead Souls thing.
If you can't abide by MudOS licensing, just port Dead
Souls to some driver that lets you do commercial stuff.
Then please tell me how you did it, so I can pass on the
leetness to others.
