## Proposal overview

BKS(Boring-Killing-Saving) is a pay-to-play Text-interactive adventure game on the Harmony platform. Players can use the ONE token to purchase assets and unlock various reputations and equipment in the game. We have already developed the first prototype of the game and it is running on the Harmony testnet.

We are requesting $60K in equity-free contribution: 

- $10K after launching a feature-complete product on testnet.
- $10K after mainnet launch.
- $10K after forming a DAO for our community.
- $10K for cooperation with other DAOs for operation or activities.
- and $20K for after 10K users. As well as funding.
- we are looking for Harmony’s help with product development, fundraising, and talent recruit.

We are a team of 2  full stack developers with high abilities. and we are confident that our game, combined with Harmony’s fast and cost-effective ecosystem will be a huge success and very popular among the Harmony community.

Our milestones are:

1. Weeks 1-3: Feature complete and deployed onto testnet
2. Weeks 3-5: Give beta access to Harmony community to test and give feedback
3. Weeks: 5-6: Deploy to mainnet and ramp up marketing efforts
4. First month after launch: Form DAO
5. Second month: Acquire 10k new users
