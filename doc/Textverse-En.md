## Abstract
+ This version is for grant.
+ Build by community, for community.
+ Textverse is a Text Metaverse(Game) Engine in Web3.
+ WE ARE THE FULL TIME WEB3 BUILDER, NOT OTHERS.

## Benefits
+ We will gain many users to join and play in **a very easy mode**: just typing on any screen.
+ We will publish NFTs to help players to own their value and assets in Web3.
+ We will be the DAO2DAO mode supplier in Web3 Text game area.
+ The DAOs will open their Text games with many topics, they are **all the users of us**.
+ It can **help any communities,DAOs** run their story within a text game.
+ We offer the **Web3 Infrastructure**, Engine on Text Game Category Primitives.
+ Also, we build a series of tools and smart contracts to **solve the engineering problems**.
+ So the community can **focus on** the Creative and Imaginations on their Metaverse. 
+ We output the **components of the Web3** with Interoperability and Composability.

## Progress
+ On developing.
+ [Our github](https://github.com/twinsant/ethos).
+ It was merged from two projects of the two genesis member:[jhfnetboy](https://github.com/jhfnetboy), and [twinsant](https://github.com/twinsant).
+ We will run the MVP in this week.
+ We will run the Demo on Harmony Test Network after 3-4 weeks.
+ We have't deploy on any chain.

## User acquisition and market
+ **Low barriers** for the players:Email and password can register and play at once(we pay the mint gas fee).
+ Free to play can gain huge number of users(buy in game is the target).
+ We will build the game of TextverseDAO, to show the playable and grasp the medal.
+ First month: 1K => Second month 10K users => Third month 30K or more users.

## Fund plan
+ We need 1.5W USDC or equivalence token to support our developing on v0.1, just fullfil the living cost.
+ We need 2-3W USDC to recruit the designer and pay some bounties to arrive at v0.2.
+ Milestone1: Week 19, MVP finished and tested.
+ Milestone2: Week 22, publish playable version. and Week 26, finish bugfix.

## Gaps or help we need
+ We need international operation experiences to run a international DAO. 
+ We need BD roles to help us to run cooperations with DAOs to make this product be used.
+ We need low cost contract audit to guarantee the security.
+ We need more developers to accelerate the building speed, or more money to recruit.
